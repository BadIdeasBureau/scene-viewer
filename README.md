# scene-viewer

Allows viewing of scene textures from within compendiums.  CTRL+right click on a scene in a compendium will render its map image in a frame - this works for images, and for .mp4 or .webm video files (which will play muted - an option will be added in a future update to let them play with sound).
Includes a loading popup (which doesn't do anything, but makes it clear that the module is doing something if the image is taking a while to load).
Does not show tiles, tokens, or lighting on the scene.

Original code by Zeel used under MIT license (and with permission).  Tweaked slightly by me.
