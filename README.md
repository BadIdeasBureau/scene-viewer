# Compendium Scene Viewer

Allows viewing of scene textures from within compendiums.  Adds an option to view the scene image to the right click context menu for scenes in a compendium (only Scenes compendiums for now - does not function for Adventures yet)
Includes a loading popup (which doesn't do anything, but makes it clear that the module is doing something if the image is taking a while to load).
Only shows the background image, does not show tiles, tokens, or lighting on the scene.
